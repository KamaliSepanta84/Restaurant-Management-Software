# Restaurant Management Software 🍽️ 
Welcome to my Restaurant Management Software project, a project designed to streamline the ordering and receipt process in a restaurant setting. This system reduces manual work, improves efficiency, and helps restaurant staff focus more on delivering great customer service.

## About the Project
