# Restaurant Management Software üçΩÔ∏è 
Welcome to my Restaurant Management Software project, a project designed to streamline the ordering and receipt process in a restaurant setting. This system reduces manual work, improves efficiency, and helps restaurant staff focus more on delivering great customer service.

## About the Project
This is a personal project I developed to help restaurants manage orders and receipts more effectively. The software features a simple yet powerful interface to make order taking and receipt generation quicker and more accurate.
## Key Features

‚Ä¢ Menu Management: Organize and update menu items efficiently. <br>
‚Ä¢ Receipt Generation: Automatically generate detailed receipts for each order. <br>
‚Ä¢ Database Integration: A structured SQLite database stores all menu items, orders, and receipts for quick retrieval. <br>
